\begin{abstract}
    We propose a deep version of SOM,
    and relate it to autoencoder.
    On one hand,
    it helps to explain why AE learns latent spaces that keeps topology,
    and why VAE tends to generate blurry results;
    on the other hand,
    It gives SOM a new perspective from probability theory.
